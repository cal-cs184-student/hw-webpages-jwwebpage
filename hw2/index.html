            <h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

            <h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
            For this part we are trying to implement the beizer curves by using the de Causteljau algorithm. This algorithm is a way to find the beizer curves by using recursion. According to the lecture, we first need to interpolate by using the given points and	insert a point, then we do that on both edges to get new controls points and then we can do this recursively until we get a point which is on the curve. The formula of the algorithm is given, so we can use this recursive step to code the algorithm which is (1-t)*Pi + t*Pi+1. We will get the point lying on the curve at the given parameter t. I created my own Beizer curve using 6 points and the result is shown in the screenshot. From the screenshot we can see each step in the evaluation process, and the final red point is the final Evaluated Point. There is another screenshot with the control points slightly changed and the t value has changed as well and we can see a slightly different curve as the result.

            <p>Here are the screenshots:</p>

            <h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
            In this part we can use the same idea of the de Casteljau algorithm to use it on Bezier surfaces in addition to Bezier curves. The idea is to use the de Casteljau algorithm on the rows and columns of the control points to get the final point on the surface. In this case, we need two parameters, u and v, and do the same recurive interpolation steps. The formula is similar for interpolating the Bezier curve, but we need to do it on both rows and columns since the bezier surface is a 2D surface and it is defined by grid of control points. First we interpolate in one direction u, then we interpolate in the other direction v. See screenshots below for the result.

            <h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

            <h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
            For this part we are trying to get the approximate unit normal at the given vertex, so we need to calculate the area-weighted vertex normals. We need to calculate the normal for each face and then we also need to weight the normal by the area of the face and sum up. To implement this method, first I start with the halfedge and find the face, since each face is a triangle, we first find every triangle face next to the vertex and then we can calculate the normal by using the cross product of the two edges. First, we need to use a while loop to go through all the halfedges and we also need to check if the face is boundary or not. If it is not a boundary face, we find the two edges by using the vertex and then we calculate the normal using the cross product of the two edges. Then we normalize the normal and we also need to weight the normal by the area of the face. We then sum up the weighted normals and normalize the final normal. From the screenshot we can see the results of before and after. We can see that after we calculate the normal, the result looks much smoother and teapot looks more realistic because the mesh is no longer flat.

            <h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
            In this part we need to correctly flip the edge and make sure that all the mesh elements as well as their pointers are changed accordingly and they are also pointing to the correct element. There are halfedges, vertices, and faces connected to the edge, so we need to update all the elements correctly. To do this, we need to first check if the edge is a boundary edge or not. If it is a boundary edge, we cannot flip it. Otherwise, we can flip the edge and proceed with the process. Then we need to get the halfedges, vertices, and faces connected to the edge and try to update these elements, making sure that after the flip they still point to the correct element respectively. We use the setNeighbors function to update all the pointers, making sure that they are correct for each of the halfedges. One problem I faced while implementing this function is that it is really hard to keep track of the elements since it is quite confusing, so one debugging trick I used is to draw the picture of elements on paper and then figure out which elements is pointing to which element. Then I can check if my code is correct by comparing my drawing with the actual code. I encountered some error at first, when I flip the edge the face is not showing up anymore, and it turns out there are some issues with the setNeighbors functions since I messed up with the correct pointer parameters. The debug trick was helpful in solving this issue. Attached are screenshots showing before and after the edge flip. We can see that the edge is flipped and the other elements and halfedges are also updated if we navigate in the GUI.
